## MamiSiaga App

MamiSiaga is a digital version of the KIA's book for moms and infants. 
This application was made to keep track of the health of pregnant mothers and children so that they can get adequate nutrition at all phases of their lives. 
MamiSiaga helps users keep track of their children's nutrition by using the KMS graph offered in the app. 
MamiSiaga also makes it easy to track data on children's conditions with OCR, which can detect KMS (children's weight), 
so mothers can scan the KMS table and the children graph will show.

1. ANC Log
